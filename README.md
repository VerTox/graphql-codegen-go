# graphql-codegen-go
Generate Go structs from your GraphQL schema.

This [code generator](https://blog.golang.org/generate) helps you derive Go structures directly from [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) schema. The schema
can be located either locally or can be fetched from GIT repository.

Install it using `go get`:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/jkrajniak/graphql-codegen-go
```
## Quick start

Simply, define the GQL schema
```graphql
type Person {
  name: String!
  age: Int!
  weight: Int
  likes: [String]
  donts: [String!]
}
```
and save it, e.g. in `schema.gql` file. Then run the code generator

```bash
$ graphql-codegen-go -schema schema.gql -packageName pkg -out models.go
```
As a result, you will get a `models.go` file with the following Go code

```go
// Code generated by go generate; DO NOT EDIT.
// This file was generated from GraphQL schema schema.gql

package pkg

type Person struct {
	Name   string    `json:"name"`
	Age    int64     `json:"age"`
	Weight *int64    `json:"weight"`
	Likes  []*string `json:"likes"`
	Donts  []string  `json:"donts"`
}
```

Notice that not required (`weight`) fields are converted to the pointers. The `packageName` option is optional. The generator
will try to derive the package name from the current running path of the code, or if run by `go:generate` from `$GOPACKAGE` env variable.

The schema does not have to be located locally. The program supports also Git repositories.
Let's assume that you the `schema.gql` file is placed in `github.com/orange/repo1` repository, inside a `deployment` directory.
Then, to generate the structures you can run the generator as follows

```bash
$ graphql-codegen-go -schema https://github.com/orange/repo1.git/deployment/schema.gql -packageName pkg -out models.go
```

### Entities

By default generator will output structures for all of the entities found in the schema. To output only a subset of structures
you can use `-entities` option.

For example
```bash
$ graphql-codegen-go -schema schema.gql -packageName pkg -out models.go -entities Person
```
will create file `models.go` only with a single structure `Person`.

**Note:** currently generator does not track the dependencies between entities.

### Union

The [union type](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types) is supported in the following way. Let's consider a schema
```graphql
type Et {
  value: String
}

type Pt {
  label: String!
}

union Ett = Et | Pt

type Entity {
  id: String!
  etpt: Ett
}
```

The union type `Ett` is converted into a Go struct `Ett`
```go
type Et struct {
	Value *string `json:"value"`
}

type Pt struct {
	Label string `json:"label"`
}

type Ett struct {
	TypeName string `json:"__typeName"`
	Et
	Pt
}

type Entity struct {
	Id   string `json:"id"`
	Etpt *Ett   `json:"etpt"`
}
```

# go:generate

The generator can work perfectly fine with the ```go:generate``` directive. The examples of how to include it can be found in `examples/` directory.
